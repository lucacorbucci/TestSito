      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my bachelor degree in 2014 and I moved to Pisa to attend the lectures at the University, here I met some Sicilian people and for 5 years they invited me to go in Sicily to see the beautiful sea and to visit all the beautiful places of this island.
I never listened to them until the last winter when I organized my first trip to Sicily and I went to Giarratana, a little village near Ragusa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the places that I visited and I also loved the sea even if it was Febraury and it was too cold to go on the beach to swim and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this first trip I decided to organize another trip, this time i changed my destination and I decided to go to “San Vito Lo Capo” a beautiful and famous touristic location in the west of the Sicily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived in Sicily on the 14th of August and I stayed there for one week, during these days I visited a lot of places and I ate a lot of delicious typical food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My trip started with a visit to some beaches near San Vito, in Italy they are called &amp;ldquo;Calette&amp;rdquo;, we rented a scooter and we went to these beaches. During the entire day the sea was rough but we appreciated the landscape and the contrast between the sea that and the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucacorbucci/lucacorbucci.github.io/master/Images/IMG_4982.jpeg?token=AAQYXWU6ODBPH2KWOPNKYR25VHX6I&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_4982.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shot the previous photo during the first day and I think that it is one of the best photo that I have ever taken with my iPhone. As you can see there are a lot of rocks on the beach and it was really funny to walk over it, from this picture you can also see the contrast between sea and mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucacorbucci/lucacorbucci.github.io/master/Images/IMG_5410.jpeg?token=AAQYXWX2KX3GBCMSSPEAO6S5VJDIC&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_5410.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucacorbucci/lucacorbucci.github.io/master/Images/IMG_4929.jpeg?token=AAQYXWQ27K2UODXAFMPEFX25VJDFQ&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_4929.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excursion to the &amp;ldquo;Riserva dello zingaro&amp;rdquo; was the one that i enjoyed most, we took a boat and we visited some caves.
It was amazing, I was really excited especially when we saw some dolphins in the sea, it was an unforgettable experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have done another excursion by boat to &amp;ldquo;Favignana&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Levanzo&amp;rdquo;, i liked it especially the &amp;ldquo;Levanzo&amp;rdquo; island that is smaller than &amp;ldquo;Favignana&amp;rdquo; but is really nice to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucacorbucci/lucacorbucci.github.io/master/Images/IMG_6078.jpeg?token=AAQYXWUDRDGX3EHFNJSO6VC5VJDUE&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_6078.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said during the days that i passed in Sicily I ate a lot of typical foods. I loved the &amp;ldquo;Arancino&amp;rdquo; and I ate one of it almost every day. The Arancino is a typical sicilian food that is prepared with rice and sauce with meat then it is fried.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucacorbucci/lucacorbucci.github.io/master/Images/IMG_4511.jpeg?token=AAQYXWTUGXM6TD4PGZNLZ7S5VJDDO&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_4511.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also ate some foods that i usually don&amp;rsquo;t eat like raw fish or also cous cous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one week I left Sicily but I promised that I&amp;rsquo;ll go back as soon as I can to visit not only the sea but also the mountainous part and some other cities (and also to eat some others Arancini and Cannoli :D).&lt;/p&gt;
