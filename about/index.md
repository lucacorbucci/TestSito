#### C/C++

Good knowledge of C and C++ programming language. I studied C during my bachelor degree and the biggest project that I implemented
is a multi thread server for a multi user chat.
During my master degree I also studied C++ and I used this language for a university project.

#### Java

I studied Java during my Bachelor degree and during the years I improved my knowledge developing some projects.
I used Java to implement a multi thread server and also to develop a distributed database.

#### HTML, CSS, Javascript

During the "Interface Programming" course in my University I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I developed a little browser game using these technologies. After the bachelor degree I improved my
web development skill learning also ReactJS. I'm currently using ReactJS to develop some personal projects.

#### Python

I studied Python by self taught and during the years I improved my knowledge reading books and developing
some personal projects.
I started my adventure with Python because I wanted to develop a Telegram Bot and now I use it in some of
my personal projects.
During my master degree I also learned to use Pandas and Numpy and some other libraries useful for Data Mining
and Machine Learning projects.

#### Database

During my bachelor degree I attended two database courses, the first one was a theoretical course and the
second was a practical course where we applied all the techniques learned in the first course.
During my master degree I attended an Advanced Database Course and during my Erasmus I also developed a distributed database for a Practical Course.
