It's the last day of 2021, one of my goals for the next year is to keep a sort of diary that I can write regularly.
I don't want to plan the number of notes I'll write in this blog. I hope I'll be able to write at least one per week.

I'd like to post short notes about my life and what I learn every day. I guess I'll also post longer stories like the ones I published on Medium in the past (I'll post these on Medium as well).

That's it! Happy 2022! ðŸŽ†
