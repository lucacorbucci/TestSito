A new year started and I want to write a post on this blog that unfortunately I didn't use too much during 2022.
The topic of this post will be the music I listened to during 2022. To be honest I didn't listen to too many music during the last year. Thanks to the Spotify Unwrapped I discovered that I listed to music for 12476 minutes this year and this was a lot less than previous years. In particular I changed my habits and I explored less new artists.

Before starting to list the albums and the singles I liked the most, I want to add just a few details about how I listen to music. I use Spotify as my primary music provider. To write this post I considered both the Spotify Unwrapped 2022 and the stats I found on Last.fm. I usually listen to music while I walk or run and sometimes in my house during the dinner or the lunch.

After this brief introduction, it's time to start with the list of the albums and the songs I listened to during the last year. I have picked one album of the year, one song of the year and then, in the "Other albums" section I'll report the other albums I liked during 2022 with no particular order. Some of the albums I'll mention are produced by italian artists.

## Album of the year

#### WE by Arcade Fire

#### Unwanted by Pale Waves

I already picked Unwanted by Pale Waves as my "Song of the year" but I think that this album also deserves a mention in this section. I would say that this album was the biggest surprise of 2022 for me.

#### C’mon You Know by Liam Gallagher

It's not a secret tha Liam Gallagher is one of my favourite artists. I was finally able to watch him live in Lucca and it was biblical. 2022 was the year of "C'mon you know", the latest album of Liam Gallagher, released in May. I loved this album and especially the songs Diamond in the dark, C'mon you know and Better Days.
I'm not sure if this is the best album released by Liam Gallagher but I loved it.

Bonus: During last year, Liam Gallagher released also the live album [Down by the River Thames](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Xwv9fGN6ytPps8OC1NSoC). It was recorded during the 5 December 2020 concert on a barge travelling down the River Thames and it is amazing. If you haven't listened to it give it a try, it will be worth it.
