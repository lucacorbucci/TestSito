A few days ago in the [Superhero Valley Discord server] one of our users asked if going to tech conferences could be helpful for a student and what could be the conferences to attend. I answered the question with my opinion on this topic and then I thought it could be a good idea to write a post about it.


## My fist tech event 

My history with tech event started more than 15 years ago (yeah, I feel old while thinking about this). I was probably 12 or 13 years old when my mother told me that she had seen an advertisement about an event called "Linux Day" organized by a local community called Tulug. At that time I did not even know what Linux was but I was already extremely attracted by computers. I shared this event with a classmate and we decided to go together. I still remember that day, it was a saturday afternoon and after school we went to the Linux Day. The event was for me. As it happens in most of the tech events we had the opportunity to attend some talks but most, importantly, we received as a 'gift' some CDs with linux distro and a lot of stickers. I still have those CDs and stickers in a box in my room. That day I discovered a new world and I started to be more and more interested in computers and technology. The chat I had with the organizers was so interesting for a 13yo child and watching people working with linux distributions with a lot of passion was something that I will never forget. I have to admit that at that time, I was particularly attracted by the effects that all of the organizers were able to have on their PC with linux. This was probably the reason why I that day I decided that I had to try Linux. 

Unfortunately, as far as I know, the Linux Day was organized only for a few times in my city and I was only able to attend it two times. Therefore, these two events were the only tech events that I attended until the beginning of the University, more than 5 years later.

## Attending the events from the last row

In 2014 I started my CS degree in Pisa. Just after a few months, in May 2015, some people organized a watch party for the Google I/O. Since I was used to watch this kind of events alone at home found this a nice thing and I decided to attend the event with some of my friends. I don't remember too much of that day except for the fact that a room with ~150 seats was almost full of people interested in the event. That one was the first event of the [GDP Pisa](). Starting from that day, for the following 4 years, I attended almost all of the events organized by this community and a few other events organized by another local community called [Gulp]().
The biggest mistake I made while taking part into these events was to attend them 'from the last row'. I was interested in the talks but I used to avoid as much as I can the networking part. I was not used to take part into the beer party after the events or to talk with people that I did not know. 

## The Erasmus 

The turning point in my experience with tech meetup was the Erasmus. I moved to Munich to spent a semester abroad in October 2019. My main goal was to improve my english that was terrible at that point. Despite following lectures in english and spending time with other students, I felt that this was not enough and that I was not challenging myself enough to improve my english. By chance I found an advertisement of an event organised by the [DSC Munich]() and I decided to attend it. It was only the first of dozens of events that I attended in Munich during the 5 months I was there. A key event was when I started to attend the [Flutter Munich]() meetup. They organized an Hackathon and then, I started to attend their meetup. It was mindblowing for me. I had never used Flutter before but I started to attend all the events and to talk with all the other attendant. After some meetups, I felt like I was one of the "" participants. I think I never expressed enough my gratitude to the organizers of the Flutter Munich meetup. It was really important for me and in the next section I'll explain why.

## Changing perspective

After attending the Flutter meetups I started to learn Flutter and to work with it. I remember that when I was close to the end of my Erasmus, in one of the last meetup I attended, I asked the organizers for some tips on how to organize a Flutter Meetup when back in Pisa. They gave me some suggestions and then I went back to Italy with the  that I wanted to organize a Flutter Meetup in Pisa. It was the end of February 2020. I guess you all know what happened in March.
