On Saturday, June 4th I was a speaker at Pycon Italy 2022 in Florence.
It was my first ever in-presence talk after two years of online events and presentations made in front of a screen.
I can't find the words to express all my joy and the emotions I felt before, during and after the talk, it was just amazing. I'm so grateful to the organizers that allowed me to be there.

I gave a talk about [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), in particular, I introduced Streamlit and I explained how can it be used to develop simple user interfaces to report, for example, the results of a project.

The slides of my talk are available [here](https://bit.ly/39rXWyq) (the English version is available [here](https://bit.ly/3Hbli89)). I published the code of the demo I prepared for the talk on [my Github account](https://github.com/lucacorbucci/PyconIT2022). Unfortunately, we had some problems before the talk and I had to change the computer so I was not able to do the demo.

See you next year!
