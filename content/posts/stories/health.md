In January 2019 I started having a lot of problems with my back. It started with some sopportabile pain and in just a few days it became more severe and I started having some difficulties while walking.
I thought it was just some back pain caused by the fact that at that period I was preparing an exam and I was spending a of hours sitting on my chair in front of my computer. I went to a "fisioterapista" for a few "sedute" and I started feeling better so I stopped going to the "fisioterapista", I went back to the city where I was studying at the time and I and I started again sitting too many hours on my desk.
I obviously underestimated the problem and it came back after just a few weeks.
For several months I have done literlaly anything to stay healthy. I woke up in the morning with back pain, I cannot run because of the pain, I cannot "piegare" to "raccogliere" something on the floor and I constantly had pain on the back and on my left leg.
In the meantime I had to move to Munich and before leaving Italy I decided to do some "fisioterapia" to stay better. It was not so useful but at least I had the impression that I was doing something useful for my health.
Obviously, it was not enough and during the 5 months I've spent in Germany I've never lived without pain.
At the end of February 2020 I went back to Italy, determined to go to a doctor and to understand what was the cause of my back pain. Guess what? A global pandemic started and I spent the following months in my home sitting on my chair, in front of my PC.
Obviously, this was not a good therapy for my back. Luckily, in October 2020 I did a RX on my back and I discoverd that I have an ernia.
This was strange at the beginning, I'm not too old and I thought these are problems for old people.
At that point I knew the cause of the problem and I started to understand that at least I need to solve it.
During the 2020 christmas holiday I started a therapy and I immediately started feeling better.
