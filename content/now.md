Updated February 18th, 2024, from my house in Barcelona. 


## My year abroad is about to end

I've been living in Barcelona for the past year and it's been a great experience. I've worked in the TelefoÃÅnica Research Lab improving a lot my skills in research. I really liked the city and the people I've met here. I'm going to miss it but It's time to go back to Italy and finish the last year of my PhD.

## What I'm working on

In this last year I've worked on the interaction between fairness and privacy in Federated Learning. We submitted a paper last month and we are waiting for the reviews. At the moment I'm working on improving the paper and the code to make it open source. We have a lot of ideas that could be worth exploring and I'm looking forward to working on them.

## What I'm reading

At the moment I'm reading "[Il gene egoista](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35451122)", the italian translation of "[The selfish Gene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61535.The_Selfish_Gene)" by Richard Dawkins. I've just started and I still don't know if I like it or not.

## What I'm watching

We are watching "[True Detective - The Night Country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkL7cpG2UhE)" with my girlfriend and we're enjoing it a lot. The last episode is about to come out tomorrow so we are looking forward to it. 
We are also watching "[The fall of the house of Usher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvuAWVzP6wI)" on Netflix. We are only at the second episode and I have not yet decided if I want to continue watching it or not.
