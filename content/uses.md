## Hardware

- **MacBook Pro 13" (2020** - M1 Processor - 16GB RAM - Probably the best computer I've ever had. It's fast, silent and the battery lasts forever. I'm really happy with it.
- **iPad 6th generation** - 32GB - I use it mainly for reading and taking notes. I'm thinking about upgrading it in 2024 but I don't use it enough to justify the expense.
- **iPhone 7 Plus** - I've had it for a while and it's still working fine. However, I think I'll replace it when the new iPhone will come out in September.
- **Amazon Kindle Paperwhite**
- **Apple Airpods Pro** - The best earphones I've ever had. I use them for everything. They're simply the best product Apple produced in years.
- **Apple Watch Series 4** - I use it mainly for logging my runs and for notifications. I think I would live without it.
- **MacBook Pro 2016 15 with Touchbar"** - Used as server for hosting some services like Plex. The screen is broken but it's still working fine if used as a server.

- **Xiaomi F2 43**
