# Desk Setup


I'm really happy with the setup I have now. I think that it allows me to be productive and to work comfortably. This last point is really important for me since I spend a lot of time in front of the computer. Here's a list of the things I have on my desk:

- The desk is a [Rodulf Standing Desk by Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/it/it/p/rodulf-scrivania-regolabile-in-altezza-grigio-bianco-s99326170/), a cheap standing desk that I bought in 2021. It's big enough and I can't live without it now.
- I've tried many desk lamps over the past few years. All of them have something that I did not like. In the end, I tried the [Xiaomi Mi Computer Monitor Light Bar](https://www.mi.com/it/product/mi-computer-monitor-light-bar/) and I think that it's the best compromise between space occupied on the desk and light produced.
- I have a [Ikea Eifred](https://www.ikea.com/it/it/p/eifred-sedia-con-appoggio-per-ginocchia-gunnared-nero-grigio-90527069/)

## Hardware

- **MacBook Pro 13" (2020)** - M1 Processor - 16GB RAM - Probably the best computer I've ever had. It's fast, silent and the battery lasts forever. I'm really happy with it.
- [Samsung Odyssey G9]() - It is a 49-inch OLED monitor. It is a pleasure for the eyes to work in front of it.
- **Apple Magic Trackpad**
- **Logitech Mx Master 3S For Mac**
- **[Keychron K8](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k8-tenkeyless-wireless-mechanical-keyboard)**
- **Apple Magic Keyboard**
- **MacBook Pro 2016 15 with Touchbar"** - Used as a server for hosting some services like Plex. The screen is broken but it's still working fine if used as a server.

## Software

- [Hidden Bar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066?mt=12)
- [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) is a porting of i3 to macOS. I've never used something like this in the past but after I started using the Samsung Odyssey G9 I decided to try it to exploit as much as possible the space offered by this monitor.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
- [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) is an open-source text expander developed by Federico Terzi. Federico [was a guest in a PointerPodcast episode](https://pointerpodcast.it/p/pointer46-espanso-rust-e-open-source-con-federico-terzi/).
- [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12)
- I've been using [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) as my iOS podcast player for years. It has a lot of interesting features that improve the podcast listening experience.
- I use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) as my password manager. Even if the user experience could be improved, I like their culture a lot. It is Open source and with the free version, you would be able to use it without too many limitations. However, I decided to support their work by buying a premium subscription.

- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)

## Other stuffs I use

- **iPad 6th generation** - 32GB - I use it mainly for reading and taking notes.
- **iPhone 7 Plus** - I've had it for a while and it's still working fine. However, I think I'll replace it when the new iPhone will come out in September.
- **Amazon Kindle Paperwhite** - This is my ebook reader, it is compact enough to 
- **Apple Airpods Pro** - The best earphones I've ever had. I use them for everything. They're simply the best product Apple has produced in years.
- **Apple Watch Series 4** - I use it mainly <del>for logging my runs and</del> for notifications. I think I would live without it.
