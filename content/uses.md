# Desk Setup
![Desk Setup](/img/desk.jpeg)

I'm really happy with the setup I have now. I think that it allows me to be productive and to work in a comfortable way. This last point is really important for me since I spend a lot of time in front of the computer. Here's a list of the things I have on my desk:

- The desk is a [Rodulf Standing Desk by Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/it/it/p/rodulf-scrivania-regolabile-in-altezza-grigio-bianco-s99326170/), a cheap standing desk that I bought in 2021. It's big enough and I can't live without it now.
- I've tried many desk lamps during the past years. All of them have something that I did not like. In the end, I tried the [Xiaomi Mi Computer Monitor Light Bar](https://www.mi.com/it/product/mi-computer-monitor-light-bar/) and I think that it's the best compromise between space occupied on the desk and light produced.

## Hardware

- **MacBook Pro 13" (2020)** - M1 Processor - 16GB RAM - Probably the best computer I've ever had. It's fast, silent and the battery lasts forever. I'm really happy with it.

- **[Keychron K8](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k8-tenkeyless-wireless-mechanical-keyboard)**

## Other stuffs I use

- **iPad 6th generation** - 32GB - I use it mainly for reading and taking notes. I'm thinking about upgrading it in 2024 but I don't use it enough to justify the expense.
- **iPhone 7 Plus** - I've had it for a while and it's still working fine. However, I think I'll replace it when the new iPhone will come out in September.
- **Amazon Kindle Paperwhite** - Is my ebook reader, it is compact enough to 
- **Apple Airpods Pro** - The best earphones I've ever had. I use them for everything. They're simply the best product Apple produced in years.
