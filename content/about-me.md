{{< /lead >}}

I’m a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pisa 🇮🇹. My main research interests are Federated Learning and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning.

🧑‍🎓 I received a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2018 and a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2021 with a thesis about “Semantic enrichment of XAI explanations for healthcare”. In 2019 I spent one semester at the Computer Science Department of the Technische Universität München 🇩🇪 as an exchange student thanks to the Erasmus program.

I worked as Flutter Developer at Tocket from March 2020 to January 2021. During that period I developed the Tocket's application that was published on the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store.

## Podcast and Communities

I enjoy organising meetups and communities. I am currently involved in the following projects:

- **PointerPodcast**
  - I’m the co-founder of “[PointerPodcast](https://pointerpodcast.it/)” a podcast about technology and innovation. We published more than 100 episodes since its creation in 2019. In most of them, we interview software engineers and researchers from both academia and industry.
- **SuperHeroesValley**
  - I'm the co-founder of “[SuperHeroesValley](https://www.superheroesvalley.fun/)”, a community that organizes online meetups for ambitious CS students to build a bridge between university and big tech companies. We founded the community in October 2020 and we organized more than 30 meetups since then.
- **Pisa.dev**
  - I'm the co-founder and organizer of [Pisa.dev](https://www.pisa.dev) a community based in Pisa that organizes meetup for developers and computer scientist. We organized our first event in July 2022.
