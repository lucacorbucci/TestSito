<em>Tech Stack: Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, Keras</em>

We joined the competition "Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets" during an exam at the University.
We developed and evaluated several machine learning models that had the aim to classify tweet as real disaster or unreal disaster.

In particular we trained the following models:

- Naive Bayes
- LSTM
- Bidirectional LSTM
- Bert

We used keras to develop the models.
