Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm Luca Corbucci, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pisa. My main research interests are Explainable AI, Federated Learning and privacy risks in federated learning.

I received a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2018 and a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science with a thesis about "Semantic enrichment of XAI explanations for healthcare".

In 2019 I spent one semester at the Computer Science Department of the Technische UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen as an exchange student thanks to the Erasmus program.

I'm the co-founder of ["PointerPodcast"](https://pointerpodcast.it/) and the co-founder of ["SuperHeroesValley"](https://www.superheroesvalley.fun/), a community that organizes meetups for ambitious CS students to build a bridge between university and big tech companies.
