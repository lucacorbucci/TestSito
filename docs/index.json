I can\u0026rsquo;t find the words to express all my joy and the emotions I felt before, during and after the talk, it was just amazing. I\u0026rsquo;m so grateful to the organizers that allowed me to be there.\nI gave a talk about Streamlit, in particular, I introduced Streamlit and I explained how can it be used to develop simple user interfaces to report, for example, the results of a project.\nThe slides of my talk are available here (the English version is available here). I published the code of the demo I prepared for the talk on my Github account. Unfortunately, we had some problems before the talk and I had to change the computer so I was not able to do the demo.\nSee you next year!\n","date":"11 June 2022","permalink":"/posts/stories/3/","section":"Posts","summary":"On Saturday, June 4th I was a speaker at Pycon Italy 2022 in Florence.","title":"My talk at Pycon IT üáÆüáπ 2022 "},{"content":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:\nFlutter After a Year of Inactivity Bugs in Hello World Why you shouldn‚Äôt use pie charts Embracing Impostor Syndrome Apple: M1 Ultra Meanings and Consequences Light Mode, Dark Mode, and Gen-Z Mode A Proposal For Type Syntax in JavaScript Inspecting Web Views in macOS Teaching is a slow process of becoming everything you hate ","date":"15 March 2022","permalink":"/posts/news/07/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:","title":"A list of blog post I've read this week - Issue #7"},{"content":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:\nAlphaCode as a dog speaking mediocre English DeepETA: How Uber Predicts Arrival Times Using Deep Learning \u0026ldquo;Math neurons\u0026rdquo; identified in the brain My journey from macOS to FreeBSD The cats sitting on a fence in early builds of Windows 8 ","date":"13 February 2022","permalink":"/posts/news/06/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:","title":"A list of blog post I've read this week - Issue #6"},{"content":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:\nHow we‚Äôre helping developers with differential privacy Practical Differentially Private Clustering When the Algorithm Is Your Boss Maze generation with Variational Autoencoders Introducing StylEx: A New Approach for Visual Explanation of Classifiers ","date":"6 February 2022","permalink":"/posts/news/05/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:","title":"A list of blog post I've read this week - Issue #5"},{"content":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:\nAI could end foreign-language subtitles 29-year-old Conway conjecture settled webassembly: the new kubernetes?

If you want a more detailed description you can read my CV or visit my LinkedIn account Hi üëã, I am Luca, a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pisa üáÆüáπ under the supervision of Prof. Anna Monreale. My main research interests are Federated Learning and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning. However, I am attracted to new technologies. Therefore, I am also open to working on different and innovative topics.\nüßë‚Äçüéì I received a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2018 and a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2021 with a thesis about ‚ÄúSemantic enrichment of XAI explanations for healthcare‚Äù. In 2019, I spent one semester at the Computer Science Department of the Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen üá©üá™ as an exchange student thanks to the Erasmus program.\nüì± I worked as a Flutter Developer at Tocket from March 2020 to January 2021.

Between 2013 and 2015, I worked as an editor for Biteyourapple.net, writing more than 1,000 posts, recording videos and participating in the Bitecast podcast. I am the PointerPodcast co-founder. PointerPodcast is a podcast about technology and innovation. We have published more than 170 episodes since its creation in 2019. In most of them, we interview software engineers and researchers from academia and industry. Lately, I have founded two communities. The first is Superhero Valley, a community that tries to fill the gap between university and industry. It does this by providing awareness of the opportunities offered by big tech companies to students. The second is Pisa.dev a local community that organizes meetups for developers and computer scientists in Pisa üáÆüáπ.\nüç¶ In my free time I enjoy acting as a critique about books and TV shows. I also try to prepare myself for marathons sooner or later.
