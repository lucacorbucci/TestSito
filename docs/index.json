It was my first ever in-presence talk after two years of online events and presentations made in front of a screen. I can\u0026rsquo;t find the words to express all my joy and the emotions I felt before, during and after the talk, it was just amazing. I\u0026rsquo;m so grateful to the organizers that allowed me to be there.\nI gave a talk about Streamlit, in particular, I introduced Streamlit and I explained how can it be used to develop simple user interfaces to report, for example, the results of a project.\nThe slides of my talk are available here (the English version is available here). I published the code of the demo I prepared for the talk on my Github account. Unfortunately, we had some problems before the talk and I had to change the computer so I was not able to do the demo.\nSee you next year!\n","date":"11 June 2022","permalink":"/posts/stories/3/","section":"Posts","summary":"On Saturday, June 4th I was a speaker at Pycon Italy 2022 in Florence.","title":"My talk at Pycon IT üáÆüáπ 2022 "},{"content":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:\nFlutter After a Year of Inactivity Bugs in Hello World Why you shouldn‚Äôt use pie charts Embracing Impostor Syndrome Apple: M1 Ultra Meanings and Consequences Light Mode, Dark Mode, and Gen-Z Mode A Proposal For Type Syntax in JavaScript Inspecting Web Views in macOS Teaching is a slow process of becoming everything you hate ","date":"15 March 2022","permalink":"/posts/news/07/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:","title":"A list of blog post I've read this week - Issue #7"},{"content":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:\nAlphaCode as a dog speaking mediocre English DeepETA: How Uber Predicts Arrival Times Using Deep Learning \u0026ldquo;Math neurons\u0026rdquo; identified in the brain My journey from macOS to FreeBSD The cats sitting on a fence in early builds of Windows 8 ","date":"13 February 2022","permalink":"/posts/news/06/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:","title":"A list of blog post I've read this week - Issue #6"},{"content":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:\nHow we‚Äôre helping developers with differential privacy Practical Differentially Private Clustering When the Algorithm Is Your Boss Maze generation with Variational Autoencoders Introducing StylEx: A New Approach for Visual Explanation of Classifiers ","date":"6 February 2022","permalink":"/posts/news/05/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:","title":"A list of blog post I've read this week - Issue #5"},{"content":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:\nAI could end foreign-language subtitles 29-year-old Conway conjecture settled webassembly: the new kubernetes?
