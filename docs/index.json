[{"content":"A few days ago in the [Superhero Valley Discord server] one of our users asked if going to tech conferences could be helpful for a student and what could be the conferences to attend. I answered the question with my opinion on this topic and then I thought it could be a good idea to write a post about it.\nMy fist tech event #My history with tech event started more than 15 years ago (yeah, I feel old while thinking about this). I was probably 12 or 13 years old when my mother told me that she had seen an advertisement about an event called \u0026ldquo;Linux Day\u0026rdquo; organized by a local community called Tulug. At that time I did not even know what Linux was but I was already extremely attracted by computers. I shared this event with a classmate and we decided to go together. I still remember that day, it was a saturday afternoon and after school we went to the Linux Day. The event was for me. As it happens in most of the tech events we had the opportunity to attend some talks but most, importantly, we received as a \u0026lsquo;gift\u0026rsquo; some CDs with linux distro and a lot of stickers. I still have those CDs and stickers in a box in my room. That day I discovered a new world and I started to be more and more interested in computers and technology. The chat I had with the organizers was so interesting for a 13yo child and watching people working with linux distributions with a lot of passion was something that I will never forget. I have to admit that at that time, I was particularly attracted by the effects that all of the organizers were able to have on their PC with linux. This was probably the reason why I that day I decided that I had to try Linux.\nUnfortunately, as far as I know, the Linux Day was organized only for a few times in my city and I was only able to attend it two times. Therefore, these two events were the only tech events that I attended until the beginning of the University, more than 5 years later.\nAttending the events from the last row #In 2014 I started my CS degree in Pisa. Just after a few months, in May 2015, some people organized a watch party for the Google I/O. Since I was used to watch this kind of events alone at home found this a nice thing and I decided to attend the event with some of my friends. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember too much of that day except for the fact that a room with ~150 seats was almost full of people interested in the event. That one was the first event of the GDP Pisa. Starting from that day, for the following 4 years, I attended almost all of the events organized by this community and a few other events organized by another local community called Gulp. The biggest mistake I made while taking part into these events was to attend them \u0026lsquo;from the last row\u0026rsquo;. I was interested in the talks but I used to avoid as much as I can the networking part. I was not used to take part into the beer party after the events or to talk with people that I did not know.\nThe Erasmus #The turning point in my experience with tech meetup was the Erasmus. I moved to Munich to spent a semester abroad in October 2019. My main goal was to improve my english that was terrible at that point. Despite following lectures in english and spending time with other students, I felt that this was not enough and that I was not challenging myself enough to improve my english. By chance I found an advertisement of an event organised by the DSC Munich and I decided to attend it. It was only the first of dozens of events that I attended in Munich during the 5 months I was there. A key event was when I started to attend the Flutter Munich meetup. They organized an Hackathon and then, I started to attend their meetup. It was mindblowing for me. I had never used Flutter before but I started to attend all the events and to talk with all the other attendant. After some meetups, I felt like I was one of the \u0026quot;\u0026quot; participants. I think I never expressed enough my gratitude to the organizers of the Flutter Munich meetup. It was really important for me and in the next section I\u0026rsquo;ll explain why.\nChanging perspective #After attending the Flutter meetups I started to learn Flutter and to work with it. I remember that when I was close to the end of my Erasmus, in one of the last meetup I attended, I asked the organizers for some tips on how to organize a Flutter Meetup when back in Pisa. They gave me some suggestions and then I went back to Italy with the that I wanted to organize a Flutter Meetup in Pisa. It was the end of February 2020. I guess you all know what happened in March.\nGiving back something to the community #Conclusions and suggestions #","date":"10 August 2024","permalink":"/posts/stories/4/","section":"Posts","summary":"A few days ago in the [Superhero Valley Discord server] one of our users asked if going to tech conferences could be helpful for a student and what could be the conferences to attend.","title":""},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Home"},{"content":" A page with a list of my writings, blogposts and similar.

I think that it allows me to be productive and to work comfortably. This last point is really important for me since I spend a lot of time in front of the computer. Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of the things I have on my desk:\nThe desk is a Rodulf Standing Desk by Ikea, a cheap standing desk that I bought in 2021. It\u0026rsquo;s big enough and I can\u0026rsquo;t live without it now. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried many desk lamps over the past few years. All of them have something that I did not like. In the end, I tried the Xiaomi Mi Computer Monitor Light Bar and I think that it\u0026rsquo;s the best compromise between space occupied on the desk and light produced. I have a Ikea Eifred Hardware # MacBook Pro 13\u0026quot; (2020) - M1 Processor - 16GB RAM - Probably the best computer I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. It\u0026rsquo;s fast, silent and the battery lasts forever. I\u0026rsquo;m really happy with it. Samsung Odyssey G9 - It is a 49-inch OLED monitor. It is a pleasure for the eyes to work in front of it. Apple Magic Trackpad Logitech Mx Master 3S For Mac Keychron K8 Apple Magic Keyboard MacBook Pro 2016 15 with Touchbar\u0026quot; - Used as a server for hosting some services like Plex. The screen is broken but it\u0026rsquo;s still working fine if used as a server. Software # Hidden Bar Aerospace is a porting of i3 to macOS. I\u0026rsquo;ve never used something like this in the past but after I started using the Samsung Odyssey G9 I decided to try it to exploit as much as possible the space offered by this monitor. Alfred Espanso is an open-source text expander developed by Federico Terzi. Federico was a guest in a PointerPodcast episode. Amphetamine I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Overcast as my iOS podcast player for years. It has a lot of interesting features that improve the podcast listening experience. I use Bitwarden as my password manager. Even if the user experience could be improved, I like their culture a lot. It is Open source and with the free version, you would be able to use it without too many limitations. However, I decided to support their work by buying a premium subscription.

If you want a more detailed description you can read my CV or visit my LinkedIn account Hi 👋, I am Luca, a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pisa 🇮🇹 under the supervision of Prof. Anna Monreale and Dr. Nicolas Kourtellis. My main research interest is Responsible AI. In particular, I am currently working on Privacy-Presering Machine Learning, Model (Un)Fairness and Explainability. However, I am attracted to new technologies. Therefore, I am also open to working on different and innovative topics.\nEducation #🧑‍🎓 I received a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2018 and a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2021 with the thesis “ Semantic enrichment of XAI explanations for healthcare”. In 2019, I spent one semester at the Computer Science Department of the Technische Universität München 🇩🇪 as an exchange student thanks to the Erasmus program.\nIn 2021 I started my PhD at the University of Pisa. During the PhD I spent 12 months as a Research Intern at the Telefonica Research Center in Barcelona 🇪🇸. I am grateful to have been supervised by Nicolas Kourtellis, Mikko Heikkila and David Solans. During this period I worked on Private and Fair Federated Learning under the Spatial EU Project.\nEducation # (2021 \u0026ndash; Present) Ph.D. in Computer Science \u0026ndash; University of Pisa, Italy 🇮🇹\nMain research interests: Private and Fair Federated Learning (Oct 2019 \u0026ndash; Mar 2020) International Exchange \u0026ndash; Technical University of Munich, Germany 🇩🇪\n(2018 \u0026ndash; 2021) Master Degree in Computer Science \u0026ndash; University of Pisa, Italy 🇮🇹\nThesis: Semantic Enrichment of XAI Explanation for Healthcare (supervisor: Prof. Anna Monreale, Dott.

Between 2013 and 2015, I worked as an editor for Biteyourapple.net, writing more than 1,000 posts, recording videos and participating in the Bitecast podcast. I am the PointerPodcast co-founder. PointerPodcast is a podcast about technology and innovation. We have published more than 170 episodes since its creation in 2019. In most of them, we interview software engineers and researchers from academia and industry. Lately, I have founded two communities. The first is Superhero Valley, a community that tries to fill the gap between university and industry. It does this by providing awareness of the opportunities offered by big tech companies to students. The second is Pisa.dev a local community that organizes meetups for developers and computer scientists in Pisa 🇮🇹.\n🍦 In my free time I enjoy acting as a critique about books and TV shows. I also try to prepare myself for marathons sooner or later.
