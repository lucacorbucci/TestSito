[{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s the last day of 2021, one of my goals for the next year is to keep a sort of diary that I can write regularly. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to plan the number of notes I\u0026rsquo;ll write in this blog. I hope I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to write at least one per week.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to post short notes about my life and what I learn every day. I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll also post longer stories like the ones I published on Medium in the past (I\u0026rsquo;ll post these on Medium as well).\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it!
